	<h1>What is Hack Club?</h1>
	<img class="rightimage" alt="Hackathon" src="./img/angelhacks.jpg" />
	<p style="text-align:justify">
		Hack Club is a community of high schoolers who are interested in computer
		science, and is <span class="accented">open to anyone</span> from the
		most experienced coding veterans to those who are writing their first
		line of code today.
	</p>
	<p style="text-align:justify">
		Agoura Hack Club is supported by the <a class="link accented"
		href="https://hackclub.com">Hack Club</a> organization, a network
		that encompasses hundreds of clubs and thousands of students just like
		us around the country and the world.
	</p>
	<h1>Philosophy</h1>
	<p>
		Hack Club members <span class="accented">learn by doing</span>, creating
		apps, websites, games and more, becoming intimately familiar with
		industry-level tools on a daily basis.
	</p>
	<p>
		Instead of the lecture format
		of traditional computer science classes, Hack Club has a much more
		hands-on approach where students learn new concepts and <span class="accented">apply them to
		real situations</span> immediately, developing programming as a skill rather
		than just an academic subject. Members are self-guided in their
		learning, using the many resources made available to them online and
		by Hack Club.
	</p>
	<h1>Community</h1>
	<img class="rightimage" alt="Slack" src="./img/slack.png" />
	<p>
		Become part of an international community of hundreds of schools and
		thousands of students, joined together by their love for CS.
		<span class="accented">Attend hackathons</span>, events where programmers
		congregate for 12 hours to several days to make amazing things from
		scratch, either alone or in small teams.
	</p>
	<p>
		Meet incredible people through various events or through the Hack Club
		<span class="accented">Slack Community</span>, where members from around
		the world can talk freely, whether it's about coding, music, TV shows,
		or anything else. It's also where members get to show off the things
		they've made to the community and the world.
